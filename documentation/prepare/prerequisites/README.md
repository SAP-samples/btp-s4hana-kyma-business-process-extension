## Instance of Connectivity Service

Instance of SAP BTP connectivity service (connectivity-proxy plan) is created to establish a secure tunnel between SAP BTP Kyma environment and a system in your On-Premise network. This provisioning must be done only once in your cluster.                                                   [Refer](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/0c035010a9d64cc8a02d872829c7fa75.html) for more details.
 If the connectivity service is not provisioned after creation of cluster by your administrator, you can do it by running the below command:

    kubectl apply -f ./script/connectivity.yaml
