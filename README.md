# SAP S/4HANA Extend Business Process Scenario in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime
## Description

The main intent of this scenario is to complement an existing business process in an SAP solution – currently SAP S/4HANA with additional business process steps. This involves adding major logic and additional data and goes beyond simple UI changes.

This application showcases:

- Building applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) using [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)
- Consuming events from SAP S/4HANA on-premise using [SAP Event Mesh](https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/df532e8735eb4322b00bfc7e42f84e8d.html)
- Consuming REST APIs from SAP S/4HANA on-premise using SAP BTP Platform Connectivity Service
- Building and deploying a function in [SAP BTP Kyma Runtime, Serverless](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/serverless)

## Business Scenario

A business scenario is used to showcase how to build a SAP S/4HANA on-premise extension application on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

John, who is an employee of Business Partner Validation Firm iCredible, which is a third-party vendor of ACME Corporation, would like to get notifications whenever new Business Partners are added in the SAP S/4HANA backend system of ACME Corporation. John would then be able to review the Business Partner details in his extension app. He would proceed to visit the Business Partner’s registered office and do some background verification. John would then proceed to update or validate the verification details into the extension app. Once the details are verified, the Business Partner gets activated in the SAP S/4HANA system of ACME Corporation.

The scenario covers:

- Custom extension application that works independently from SAP S/4HANA

- Changes in SAP S/4HANA communicated via events in real time to extension application

- Compute intensive processing available on demand (using serverless)

- Vendor personnel needs access to only custom app

## Architecture

### Solution Diagram

![solution diagram](./documentation/images/solutionDiagram.jpg)

The Business Partner Validation application is developed using CAP and runs on the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime. It consumes platform services like SAP Event Mesh, SAP HANA and Connectivity. The events occuring in SAP S/4HANA on-premise are inserted into the SAP Event Mesh queue. The application running in Kyma is notified on events, consumes them from the queue and inserts the event data into the SAP HANA database. The Business Partner Validation Application uses SAP S/4HANA REST API's to read additional Business Partner Data from the SAP S/4HANA system. in a next step, the Business Partner Validation App uses an event-driven approach as well by firing events that get consumed by Serverless Function which posts the relevant business partner data to SAP S/4HANA on-premise system using SAP S4/HANA OData api's.
